## about
A ESP-32 based growbox connected to wifi, controlled through a web-interface. It controls the lights, temperature and humidity through sensor, fan,
led panel and a heating element. It is possible to set up custom light-on and light-off times. The growbox also generates graphs of temperature and humidity. The system is also capable of regulating the temperature and airflow inside itself.

This project was developed as a part of VUB & Colruyt competition.
